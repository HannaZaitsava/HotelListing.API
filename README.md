This is a project I have created during the Ultimate ASP.NET Core Web API Development course that I took in summer 2024.

Things I have learnt:
- Build A Data Driven API using Entity Framework .NET 6 / 8
- How to Build RESTful APIs with proper practices
- Configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
- Enterprise Level Design Patterns
- Use AutoMapper and Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)
- Asynchronous Programming
- Custom Logging using SeriLog
- Use Swagger UI Documentation
- Deploy API to Microsoft Azure
- API Versioning
- API Caching

<b>The solution contains next three projects:</b>
- HotelListing.API - a project that contains application configuration and setting, and all the controllers for the API;
- HotelListing.API.Core - a project that contains DTOs and their mapping on data classes, repositories contracts and their implementations
- HotelListing.Data - a project that contains all the data classes and their configurations (code first data base), and data base migrations
